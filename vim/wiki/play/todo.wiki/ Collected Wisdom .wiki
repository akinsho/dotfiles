There's a trick to the Graceful Exit.
It begins with the vision to recognize
when a job, a life stage, a
relationship is over -- and to let go.
It means leaving what's over without
denying its validity or its past
importance in our lives. It involves a
sense of future, a belief that every
exit line is an entry, that we are
moving on, rather than out. The trick
of retiring well may be the trick of
living well. It's hard to recognize
that life isn't a holding action, but a
process. It's hard to learn that we
don't leave the best parts of ourselves
behind, back in the dugout or the
office. We own what we learned back
there. The experiences and the growth
are grafted onto our lives. And when we
exit, we can take ourselves along --
quite gracefully.
